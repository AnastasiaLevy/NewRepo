                <p>The focus of our laboratory is the examination of cognition across the lifespan from 5 to 95 years of age. We recruit participants from the community, college classes, the children or brothers and sisters of students, and we get a number of participants by word of mouth (the snowball method). Participants show up for a variety of reasons and the money and/or extra credit that we give to students for participation is probably only a major reason in the case of students. Older participants frequently express an altruistic motive of helping researchers with their work and wanting to contribute to the research. Often, a secondary motive in the sixty-plus individuals is to find out if a change they are experiencing in their abilities is a normal consequence of getting older. Among our younger participants we get students and /or their younger siblings. Some of these individuals have been diagnosed with an Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Individuals who have been diagnosed with ADHD are allowed to participate in our research and given all the tests that we typically give to participants. They are simply not included in our database used for examining how cognition changes across the lifespan.</p>
                <p>One of the tests we give has the generic label of ‘continuous performance test’ (CPT). We have administered several different commercial and noncommercial versions of the CPT but have settled on the Connors-CPT along with a few noncommercial CPTs we have created in the laboratory. The commercially available Connors-CPT that is provided to qualified individuals is frequently used to assess attention. It is akin to the Go/no-Go test used in the 20th century to examine inhibition in laboratory settings. Individuals are shown a series of letters presented in the center of a computer screen and are instructed to press the spacebar to all letters (targets), but to inhibit the spacebar press when the letter X (non-target) appears. There are a number of rather sophisticated measures extracted from an individual’s performance on this test as compared to norms based on individuals without an ADHD diagnosis. Among the most important are errors of ‘omission’. These are failures to spacebar press to target letters. Errors of ‘commission’ are spacebar presses to the letter X. From this information the researcher/clinician gets a score that measures the ability of the participant/client to discriminate between targets and non-targets.  This test is like other neuropsychological tests in that by itself in should not be used to infer a diagnosis. In our experience, we see children that have been diagnosed with ADHD based on subjective observations and/or questionnaires filled out by parents and/or teachers.</p>
                <p>
                    Now a little about this blog: There is much more to say about ADHD and the related tests we and others use for assessment of this disorder. This topic will come up again but we are limited by time and other obligations. We will cover psychological issues, allow limited comments and feedback on our opinions, and occasionally respond to comments. Look for us later in the week.

                <p class="text-white">August 05 by Dragut Adriana Cristina, MS LCP</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>      Studies show that around 60% of men and 50% of women experience at least one traumatic event in their lives.  The reality is that many people around us are facing Posttraumatic Stress Disorder which makes their daily activities become a constant struggle. Yet not many are able to find the most appropriate form of therapy that is able to help them subside PTSD symptoms and truly make sense of the events they had to go through.</p>
                <p>
                    PTSD is developed after experiencing or witnessing a shocking, dangerous or even life-threatening event. The symptoms we experience depend on the frequency of those events and the impact they had on us. When working with a client that shows symptoms of PTSD, many therapists consider EMDR (Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing) the appropriate way to approach this type of affliction. Another effective form of therapy for PTSD is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in the forms of Cognitive Processing Therapy or Prolonged Exposure. However, studies show that EMDR is usually able to work faster than CBT in reprocessing traumatic memories.
                </p>
                <p>
                    EMDR was originally designed to treat traumatic memories. It’s based on the adaptive information processing model which presents our brains own physiological processing system and how new associations help with the adaptive reprocessing. EMDR uses bilateral eye movements to stimulate both areas of our brain in order to reprocess certain memories.
                </p>
                <p>
                    EMDR doesn’t make you forget any of the events that you’ve been through, it only changes your perception about them. The goal is to be able to remember the traumatic memory without feeling any kind of negative sensation in the body. After the traumatic event has been reprocessed you won’t feel the same distress while remembering it and even some details of that certain memory tend to fade away.  It’s also important to understand that once set in motion, your brain will continue to process the traumatic memory even after the session and you might find yourself having surprising thoughts or dreams during the following days.

                    This week the New York Times reported on Google’s firing of an employee for writing a memo and placing it on the companywide email system. The memo was written by James Damore, a software engineer, who was subsequently fired by Sundar Pichai, Google’s CEO. Damore argued that the sex differences in employee coders favoring males (80% male) might be due to biological differences between males and females. Journalists writing in several major newspapers acknowledge that Damore had cited relevant peer reviewed articles supporting his view that biological (genetic) differences in personality and mathematical ability might in part account for the differences in employee sex ratio. In general, his memo was not viewed as a demented rant against women. In fact, David Brooks and Peter Singer in the New York Times and New York Daily News, argue that Pichai should not have fired Mr. Damore. Brooks argues that the thoughtless political correctness demonstrated by Mr. Pichai should results in his resignation.</p>

                   <p> The reactions by commentators on Mr. Damore’s position varied from ‘Hogwash” on one side of a long running scientific debate to the view that there is scientific evidence for substantial brain and behavioral sex differences. When sex or race get attached to debates about the cultural/biological contributions to attributes such as personality or intelligence, sparks tend to fly. My personal view is that virtually no scientist who has considered the nature versus nurture debate, thinks either is solely responsible for these complex attributes.</p>

                <p> Components of intelligence demonstrate a bell-shaped distribution with most people in the middle and a smaller highly talented group of individuals on the far right tail. Germane to the brouhaha at Google, is an article in the December 2016 issue of the highly regarded scientific journal Intelligence that reports on the mathematical and verbal sex differences over the last 50-20 years. Math scores on the SAT extend back to the early 1960s. In a nutshell, if one examines the far right 5% or .01% females are better than males on tests of verbal ability and this advantage has remained stable over the last 20 or so years. The mathematical advantage for males shown in this far-right tail of the bell curve has shrunk from the early 1960 measurements but has remained stable in favor of males over the last 20 or so years.</p>

                   <p> So, what are we to make of Mr. Damore’s firing. By my view, he made a reasoned argument based on his reading of the scientific literature. Mr. Pichai fired him not because he was right or wrong, but because in his view this was an abhorrent sexist argument contrary to his views and goals for Google.

                <p>I was a Psychology graduate student in the laboratory of Mark Rosenzweig (pictured on the left in the linked article) during the 1970s. Most of my work was with Mark Rosenzweig and Edward Bennett on the role of brain protein synthesis in long-term memory formation. Other work pioneered by Rosenzweig, Bennett, and Diamond was on the brain effects induced by the environment. The brain changes induced by differential laboratory environments (enriched, impoverished, and standard) were counter to the dogma of the first half of the 20th century that presented the brain as a fixed structure. I asked to work in this paradigm and was given the assignment of looking at brain changes in young, middle-aged, and old rats placed in differential environments for differing amounts of time. Dr. Diamond provided guidance on what features of the brain I should examine and taught me Golgi staining as well as several other basic techniques I needed for my research. After 18 months of changing the toys and mazes daily in the enrichment cages and daily feeding, watering and cleaning a respiratory virus struck the rat colony and I lost 90% of my animals. I fell back on the protein synthesis studies I had done for my dissertation. I was disappointed and Marian Diamond invited me to dinner at her home with her and her husband. They reminded me how much I’d learned, the wonderful people I’d worked with, the great institution I was at, and that the last 18 months was certainly not a loss. I don’t remember much about neuronal staining techniques, but I do remember that Marian Diamond was an exceptional mentor and teacher.</p>

                                Components of intelligence demonstrate a bell-shaped distribution with most people in the middle and a smaller highly talented group of individuals on the far right tail. Germane to the brouhaha at Google, is an article in the December 2016 issue of the highly regarded scientific journal Intelligence that reports on the mathematical and verbal sex differences over the last 50-20 years. Math scores on the SAT extend back to the early 1960s. In a nutshell, if one examines the far right 5% or .01% females are better than males on tests of verbal ability and this advantage has remained stable over the last 20 or so years. The mathematical advantage for males shown in this far-right tail of the bell curve has shrunk from the early 1960 measurements but has remained stable in favor of males over the last 20 or so years.

                            <p>So, what are we to make of Mr. Damore’s firing. By my view, he made a reasoned argument based on his reading of the scientific literature. Mr. Pichai fired him not because he was right or wrong, but because in his view this was an abhorrent sexist argument contrary to his views and goals for Google.</p>

                                The reactions by commentators on Mr. Damore’s position varied from ‘Hogwash” on one side of a long running scientific debate to the view that there is scientific evidence for substantial brain and behavioral sex differences. When sex or race get attached to debates about the cultural/biological contributions to attributes such as personality or intelligence, sparks tend to fly. My personal view is that virtually no scientist who has considered the nature versus nurture debate, thinks either is solely responsible for these complex attributes.

                                This week the New York Times reported on Google’s firing of an employee for writing a memo and placing it on the companywide email system. The memo was written by James Damore, a software engineer, who was subsequently fired by Sundar Pichai, Google’s CEO. Damore argued that the sex differences in employee coders favoring males (80% male) might be due to biological differences between males and females. Journalists writing in several major newspapers acknowledge that Damore had cited relevant peer reviewed articles supporting his view that biological (genetic) differences in personality and mathematical ability might in part account for the differences in employee sex ratio. In general, his memo was not viewed as a demented rant against women. In fact, David Brooks and Peter Singer in the New York Times and New York Daily News, argue that Pichai should not have fired Mr. Damore. Brooks argues that the thoughtless political correctness demonstrated by Mr. Pichai should results in his resignation.
